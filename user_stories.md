#User Stories(MVP)  
As a user, I want a webpage that displays BusMall catalogs that are  placed on Puget Sound regional transit system buses...
a catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel.  


As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information
As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand
Also wants to feature only the items in its catalog that are the most likely to sell.  
And also, to have the group members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.  

And You are also responsible for the look and feel of the app, so don't forget a custom font, color palette, layout with semantic HTML, and so on.

As marketing research team, I want not only be interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown
